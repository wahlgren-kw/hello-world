#My name is Kyle Wahlgren and I live in Tigard, Oregon.  I am married with three children named Molly, Andrew, and Patrick.  Last week, we went to San Diego for vacation.
#We went to Lego Land, the Birch Aquarium, Sea World, Hotel del Coronado for brunch, In-N-Out Burger, the San Diego Zoo, Coronado Beach, and a City Cruise around San Diego Harbor.  
#It was an action packed week.  I love spending time with my family.
